Region & Availability Zones :AWS Resources are hosted in multiple locations world-wide,
these locations are composed of regions and Availability Zones. 
Each region is a separate geographic area. Each region has multiple, 
isolated locations known as Availability Zones. 

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2): 
===================================
1) This Service is related to Server Configuration
like 
 a) " Type of Instance", 
 b) " What type of OS we need to install",
 c) " Where we need to Launch the server"
 d) " Creating new volumes"
 e) " adding/removing volumes from server" 
 f) " Taking back of the server (Snapshot)" 
 g) " Creating Load Balancers"
 h) " Creating Auto Scalling" etc.


2) We can launch EC2 instances any region. 
 
To Launch an Ec2 instance below resources are required:
=======================================================
a) AMI
b) Security Group
c) Keypair
d) Type of Instance

Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) : 
============================
a) An AMI is a template that contains a 
software configuration (operating system,application server and applications) that 
can run on Amazonâ€™s Ec2.AMIs can be used to launch an instance.
b) AMI is specific to the region.
c) Each AMI have its own unique ID.
d) We can Create our own AMIs.

Security Group:
==============
a) SG is a virtual firewall. It can be attached to the Ec2 instance.
b) SG configration is having two parts
    i) Inbound rules
    ii)outbound Rules
b) What type of requests server allows, will be configured in Inboud Rules.
c) What type of requests server can send, will be configured in Outbound Rules.
d) In SG we can Configure only allow rules.
e) One security Group can be attached to Multiple Ec2 instances.
f) One Ec2 instance can have upto max of "5" Security Groups.
 
Keypair:
=======
a) To log in to your instance, you must create a key pair, specify the name of the 
key pair when you launch the instance, and provide the private key when you connect 
to the instance. 

b) On a Linux instance, the public key content is placed in an entry within "~/.ssh/authorized_keys". 
This is done at boot time and enables you to securely access your instance using 
the private key instead of a password. 

c) Keypairs are region specific.

Type of Instance :
==================
Amazon EC2 provides a wide selection of instance types optimized to fit different use 
cases. Instance types comprise varying combinations of CPU, memory, storage, 
and networking capacity and give you the flexibility to choose the appropriate mix 
of resources for your applications.

Ex :
t2.nano,t2.micro,t2.small,t2.medium,t2.large,t2.xlarge,t2.2xlarge

Creating Securuty Group:
=======================
a) Goto EC2 DashBoard
b) On the navigation bar select region for the Security Group
c) Click SecurutyGrouop (NETWORK & SECURITY Sec) in the navigation pane 
d) click on Create Security Group.
e) Specify a name and description for the security group.
f) choose a VPC ID to create a security group for that VPC.
g)start adding rules.

Creating Keypair:
================
a) Goto EC2 DashBoard
b) On the navigation bar select region for the key pair
c) Click Key Pairs in the navigation pane 
d) Click Create Key Pair
e) Enter a name for the key pair in the Key Pair Name field of the dialog box and 
click Create
f) The private key file, with .pem extension, will automatically be downloaded by 
the browser. 


Creating an Ec2 Instance:
=========================
a) Goto EC2 DashBoard
b) From the navigation bar select the region for the instance
c) From the Amazon EC2 console dashboard, click Launch Instance 
d) Select the AMI (Ex: Ubuntu16)
5)	Select the instance type (ex : t2.micro)
6)	Click Next: Configure Instance Details
7)	Click Next: Add Storage
8)	Click Next: Add Tags
9)	Click Next: Configure Security Group.
10)	Click Review and Launch.Scroll down to review the AMI details, instance type, 
and security group information, and then click Launch.
11)	At the prompt for a key pair:Select Choose an existing key pair/NewKeyPair 
12)Click the check box to acknowledge that you have access to the private key.
13) Click Launch Instances.

Note : 
a) You can also attach existing SecurutyGrouop to ec2 instance.
b) you can connect to linux ec2 instance by ssh protocal.

    ssh -i "privatekeyname.pem" username@public_ip
	

Userdata (Bootstrap Scripts):
=============================
1) Whatever the command we write in Userdata feild,
these commands get executed at the time server booting.
2) Userdate can be changed on existing servers only it 
is in "Stopped" state.
3) We will this option to start the some services,
to clear the exsting log files.
4) First line of user data must be 
   "Shebang" (#! /bin/bash), After the we can give in
   any valid os commands.
	
Note : You will find "User data" feild ,In instance creation Process, 
"Configure Instance Details" step is having
section called "AdvancedDetailed".

Terminate Ec2 instance:
=======================
1) Goto EC2 DashBoard
2) Select The ec2 instance
3) Action --> Instance State --> "Terminate"

Stop Ec2 instance: If instance is in running state we can stop the instance
==================
1) Goto EC2 DashBoard
2) Select The ec2 instance
3) Action --> Instance State --> "Stop"

Note: When we stop the instance  public will be removed from the instance.
when we start the instance new public ip will be assigned to ec2 instance. 


Reboot Ec2 instance: If instance is in running state we can "Reboot" the instance
====================
1) Goto EC2 DashBoard
2) Select The ec2 instance
3) Action --> Instance State --> "Reboot"

Note: When we reboot the instance,public ip will not be changed.


Practice:
=========
1) Launch an ec2 instance in Mumbai region
2) Launch an ec2 instance in Mumbai region "ap-south-1a" AZ.
3) Create a security group and configure inbound "ssh" & "http" rules
4) Attach "step3" security group to "step2" ec2 instance.
5) Stop the "step2" ec2 instance and check the public ip address.
6) start the Ec2 instance after step5 execution,check the public ip address.
7) Create new keypair
8) Launch an ec2 instance using step3 "SecurityGroup" & step7 keypair
9) Install apache2 in Ubuntu Ec2 instance  at the time of Launch.

Elastic IP(EIP):
================
It is a dedicated public IP address which
is reserved for your account, It can be assigned any ec2 instance in you account.
After attaching it to ec2 instance,Even if we stop the ec2 instance this public will
not be released from instance , It remain attached with EC2 instance.

Create EIP (Reserv EIP):
 1) Goto EC2 dashboard
 2) Goto NETWORK & SECURITY sections
 3) Click On "Elastic IPs" 
 4) Click on "Allocate New Address"
 
Assigning Elastic IP to Ec2 Instances
1)  Goto EC2 dashboard
 2) Goto NETWORK & SECURITY sections
 3) Click On "Elastic IPs" 
 4) Click On " ACTIONS" --> "Associate Adress"
 5) Select the Ec2 instance
 
Realese Elastic IP From Ec2 AWS account:
=======================================
 step1: Realese the ELASTIC ip from Instances
     a)  Goto EC2 dashboard
	 b) Goto NETWORK & SECURITY sections
	 c) Click On "Elastic IPs" 
     d) Click On " ACTIONS" --> "Disassociate Adress"
 step 2: Realese the ELASTIC ip from Account
   a)  Goto EC2 dashboard
	 b) Goto NETWORK & SECURITY sections
	 c) Click On "Elastic IPs" 
	 d) Select Elastic Ip
	 e)  Click On " ACTIONS" --> "Release Adress"
 
Note : only five EIP can be reserved for account.

Practice:
=========
1) Create EIP and attach it to any existind Ec2 instance.
2) Stop the EC2 instance and check public is released or not from the Instance.
3) Realese the EIP from EC2 instance
4) Realese the EIP from your account.
